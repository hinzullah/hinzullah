# Hi, I'm Kamol Oduola Alao 👋

Frontend developer focused on building clean, responsive user experiences using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — with growing experience in TypeScript, React, and Web3 / smart contracts. I enjoy building interactive front-ends, learning blockchain tooling (Foundry, Hardhat, Solidity), and shipping small, useful full‑stack projects.

## 🔭 What I build
I work on frontend applications, small full-stack apps, and Web3 projects — from UI components and animations to smart-contract experiments and dApps.

Current focus areas:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React
- Web3 / Smart Contracts: Solidity, Foundry, Hardhat, Ethers.js, Wagmi
- Tooling & UX: Framer Motion, drag & drop, responsive design
- Learning: deeper hands-on with blockchain development and dApp architecture

---

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools
- Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Solidity, Python
- Frontend: React, Framer Motion, drag & drop libraries
- Web3: Foundry, Hardhat, Ethers.js, Wagmi, MetaMask
- Backend / tooling: Node.js, npm/yarn
- Other: Git, VSCode, Chrome DevTools
